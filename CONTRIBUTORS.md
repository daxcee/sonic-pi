# Contributors

We would like to express our sincerest thanks and gratitude to everyone
that has helped with either the development of Sonic Pi or supported its
use in any capacity. On its own Sonic Pi is just a piece of
software. Only when combined with our kind and generous community does
it become a powerful tool for sharing and celebrating the creativity of
code. Thank-you everyone.


## A humble beginning

generous support of others. We would like to offer our considered
gratitude to the following people who provided support in the early days
of Sonic Pi with their time, advice, and wisdom:

## Core Team Thanks

Sam Aaron would like to express his deep thanks to his family and
friends who have supported him over the years and given him the strength
to continue on this strange and often unforgiving path. He would
particularly like to thank his friend and partner Susanna and also his
fab Mum.

Luis Lloret wants to thank his wonderful family for their understanding
and support while working on this. Specially Marina, you are my reason
to live. Mar and Darío, keep being so special and giving us so much joy.

Xavier Riley would like to thank his wife Emily, and he'd like to
reassure her that he definitely loves her more than any computer. Also
big thanks to conference organizers, in particular Simon Starr for
putting on the awesome Bath Ruby conferences and letting me rock out
there not [once](https://youtu.be/Jp0VKD_7pmw?t=10m1s), but
[twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L06FlSoiBi4). Lastly I'd like to
thank Scott Wilson for teaching me some programming as part of a music
degree, and my good friend David Bamber for helping me get started as a
programmer.

Adrian Cheater dedicates this space in loving memory of her mother,
Katherine Cheater. Mom shared her passion for music and performance
and equipped me with all the tools I needed to live life fully. She was
kind, but did not let the opinions of strangers deter her from her path.
Though mom never met me as her daughter, I know she would have been proud
that I chose to embrace my truth as it became known to me.
My wish is that you, fellow musician, will also choose to never dampen your
light, and that you will encourage and empower others to shine bright.

Robin Newman would like to thank Sam for producing such inspirational
software as Sonic Pi. Both the sounds that it can produce and the
intricate programming beneath the surface are a work of art. To work
with Sonic Pi gives me such a buzz as I have not experienced since
working with Music on a network of BBC Micros in the 1980s. Then as now
my Wife Julia describes herself as a computer widow. I thank her for
putting up with my passion for musical programming over the years.

Ethan Crawford is grateful to his parents for giving him the opportunity
of music lessons as a young boy, and all the skills and interests that
this helped to develop. He'd also like to thank Sam for creating Sonic
Pi and the ease and fun with which it combines two of his favourite
interests - music and programming.
